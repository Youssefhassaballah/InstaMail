## `ðŸŒŸ`Project Objectives

* Enhance Usability: Provide a clean, user-friendly interface for managing emails.
* Streamline Communication: Enable multi-recipient support and contact management.
* Simplify Organization: Offer folder management, advanced sorting, and filtering.
* Enable Real-Time Updates: Use SSE for instant email notifications.
* Strengthen Security: Implement JWT authentication and BCrypt encryption.
* Apply Design Patterns: Ensure scalability and efficiency with proven patterns.
* Support Scalability: Handle growing user demands with a robust architecture.
* Promote Learning: Demonstrate real-world applications of engineering principles.

## `ðŸ”§`Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: JWT & BCrypt
- **Real-Time Communication**: SSE (Server-Sent Events)

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of core application services like database connections.
2. **Proxy Pattern**: Limits login attempts to enhance security and prevent brute force attacks.
3. **Strategy Pattern**: Allows dynamic email sorting by different criteria.
4. **Filter Pattern**: Enables filtering emails by categories like Inbox, Sent, and Trash.
5. **Prototype Pattern**: Efficiently handles emails sent to multiple recipients by cloning email objects.

## `ðŸš€`System Features

- **Email Management**: Compose, send, receive, and organize emails into customizable folders.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Stay updated with new emails using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- **Advanced Search & Filters**: Locate and sort emails by categories, keywords, or folders.
- **Contact Management**: Save recipient details for quicker email composition.
- **Email Attachments**: Attach files to emails with ease.
- **Security**: Secure authentication using JWT and hashed passwords with BCrypt.
- **Sorting**: Dynamically sort emails by date, sender, or subject.
